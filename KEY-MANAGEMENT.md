# üîê Private Data Storage Flow on 0G Storage

## **Step 1: Data Preparation**

* Users (non-technical, no-code) simply upload **files (CSV, JSON, etc.)**.
* The system automatically generates a **master key K** (AES/ChaCha20).
* The data is **encrypted with K** before upload.

üëâ 0G Storage only stores **ciphertext**, not the original data.

---

## **Step 2: Data Upload**

* Encrypted data (ciphertext) is uploaded to **0G Storage** (Key-Value or Object layer).
* After successful upload, 0G returns:

  * **`rootHash`**: a hash proving data integrity.
  * **`tx`**: an on-chain transaction recorded on 0G Chain.
* Metadata (`rootHash`, `tx`) can be stored in a smart contract to prove **data ownership**.

## **Step 3: Key Management**

### **Flow A ‚Äì Keys stored on Foundation Server (simpler)**

1. The master key `K` is stored in a **Foundation-managed Key Vault** (e.g., HSM or secured storage).
2. When a user wants to access data:

   * A **token-gated smart contract** verifies whether the user owns the required NFT/Token.
   * If valid ‚Üí the Foundation server **wraps `K`** with the user‚Äôs public key and delivers it.
3. The user decrypts `K` with their private key.
4. The user then uses `K` to decrypt their data retrieved from 0G Storage.

‚ö° Simple, user-friendly, works for nocode users, but Foundation has custody of the key.

### **Flow B ‚Äì MPC / Threshold Encryption (advanced)**

* Instead of storing the master key `K` on the Foundation server, it is split into **multiple key shares** using MPC/Threshold cryptography.
* A valid subset of nodes must collaborate to reconstruct `K`.
* No single party (including Foundation) can control the entire key.

‚ö° More decentralized and censorship-resistant, but technically more complex.

---

## **Step 4: Data Access**

* Once the user has `K`, they can decrypt their files locally.
* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) runs **locally on the client**.
* **Conversation history & private data remain on the user‚Äôs device**.
