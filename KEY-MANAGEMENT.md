# 🔐 Private Data Flow on 0G Storage

## **Step 1: Data Preparation**

* Persona Owner has a knowledge base (docs, embeddings, vector DB...).
* Generate a **master key K** (symmetric key AES/ChaCha20).
* Use `K` to **encrypt the data** before uploading.

👉 At this point, 0G Storage only stores ciphertext. Without `K`, no one can read the data.

---

## **Step 2: Upload Data**

* Upload ciphertext → 0G Storage (Key-Value / Object layer).
* Include metadata (hash, proof).
* Smart contract may register ownership (Persona Owner = data owner).

---

## **Step 3: Key Management**

Two possible flows:

### **Flow A – Server Holds the Key (Simpler)**

1. `K` is stored on a **dedicated server**.
2. When a user requests access:

   * Smart contract checks if the user owns the required NFT/Token.
   * If yes, the server wraps `K` with the user’s public key → sends it back.
3. User decrypts the wrapped key with their private key → obtains `K`.
4. User decrypts data from 0G Storage.

⚡ Pros: Easy to implement, good for MVP.
⚠️ Cons: Centralized trust (if server is hacked, security is compromised).

---

### **Flow B – MPC / Threshold Encryption (Advanced)**

1. `K` is **split into multiple fragments (K1, K2, K3, …)** using Secret Sharing.
2. Validators / trusted nodes in **0G Compute or 0G Chain** each hold a fragment.
3. When a user requests access:

   * Smart contract verifies user has the NFT/Token.
   * An **MPC protocol** is triggered.
   * Nodes collaborate to wrap `K` with the user’s public key (without reconstructing `K` in one place).
4. User decrypts the wrapped key with their private key → obtains `K`.
5. User decrypts data from 0G Storage.

⚡ Pros: Highly secure, decentralized, no single point of failure.
⚠️ Cons: Complex, more expensive, higher latency.

---

## **Step 4: Data Access**

* With `K`, the user decrypts ciphertext from 0G Storage.
* RAG runs **locally on the client/agent** (not backend) to generate answers.
* Ensures **conversation history + private data never leave the user’s side**.

| Stage              | Flow A (Server Key)        | Flow B (MPC / Threshold) |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| MVP Implementation | ✅ Easy                     | ❌ Complex                |
| Security           | Medium                     | High                     |
| Decentralization   | ❌ No                       | ✅ Yes                    |
| Cost               | Low                        | High                     |
| Best for           | Early PoC, small user base | Scaling, multi-persona   |

👉 In summary:

* **Early stage** → Use **Flow A (Server Key)** for quick MVP.
* **Scaling stage** → Move to **Flow B (MPC/Threshold)** for trustless decentralization.
